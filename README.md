private ArrayDeque<Double> instance member
a method called load that performs the following tasks: 
Ask the user to input a value in a loop that is controlled by the user.  If the user attempts to add more than 50 values, remove the oldest value from the container before adding the new value.  Hint: You can test this with 5 values, then modify the limit to 50 before submitting the project.  You will also need to convert the input value to a Double: Convert java double to Double object Example (Links to an external site.)
a method called pop that will display and remove the top potency value (most recently added value) from the ArrayDeque.
a method called unload that includes a loop to display and remove the most recently added value in the ArrayDeque until the ArrayDeque is empty.  This should display 50 total values.
Main Method
Create an object of the boundedStack class and call all of its methods.
